## 1. What We Learned Today

We have covered the foundational pillars of R programming for bioinformatics:

-   **The Ecosystem:** Understanding the difference between **Base** **R, RStudio, CRAN**, **BioConductor, and GitHub**.

-   **The Basics:** Mastering data types (vectors, factors, lists) and the "home base" of the **Working Directory**.

-   **Data Wrangling:** Using `dplyr` verbs and the **Pipe (`%>%`)** to turn messy spreadsheets into clean tables without creating intermediate "clutter."

-   **Visualization:** Moving beyond basic plots to the layered "Grammar of Graphics" in **`ggplot2`**.

-   **Reproducibility:** Learning how to write robust functions and manage project scripts.

## 2. What’s Next?

Today was about the **mechanics** of R. In the next stage, we move toward **interpretation**.

### Statistics in R Workshop (Part 2)

-   **Data Wrangling:** Advanced joining of datasets (merging clinical data with genomic counts).

-   **Statistical Analysis:** Performing T-tests, ANOVA, and correlation studies.

-   **Regression:** Building linear models to understand the relationship between variables.

-   **Reporting:** Using Quarto to create automated PDF or HTML reports for your PI.

## 3. Resources for Continued Learning

As you continue your R study, these resources will be your best friends:
