## 0. The Working Directory

The **Working Directory** is the specific folder on your computer where R is currently "looking" for files. Think of it as R's "home base."

-   **`getwd()`**: Run this in the console to see your current "home base" address.

-   **`setwd()`**: Use this to change where R is looking.

### 0.1 How to Find Your Current "Home Base"

There are two main ways to check where R is looking:

1.  **Using Code:** Run `getwd()` in the console. R will return the full "GPS address" (path) of your current location.

2.  **Using Your Eyes:** Look at the top of your **Console** panel. Right next to your R version info, you will see a file path (often starting with `~/`).

**Finding Your Working Directory from the console panel:**

Right next to your R version, you will see a file path starting with `~/`.

This is your **Working Directory**—the specific folder on your computer where R is currently "looking" for files.

There is a small gray arrow next to the path in the Console. Clicking this will immediately refresh your **Files** pane (bottom-right) to show you exactly what is inside your working directory.

:::

### 0.2 Three Ways to Change Your Directory

If R is looking in the wrong place, you need to move it. You can do this interactively or through code.

#### **Method A: The Script Tab (Interactive)**

If you have a script saved in your project folder, right-click the **Script Tab** at the top of your editor and select **"Set Working Directory."**

![](../images/RWData_1.png){fig-align="center" width="60%"}

#### **Method B: The Files Pane (Interactive)**

In the **Files** pane (bottom-right), navigate to the folder you want. Click the **"More"** gear icon and select **"Set As Working Directory."**

![](../images/RWData_2.png){fig-align="center" width="60%"}

#### **Method C: Using Code (`setwd()`)**

This is the most direct way, but it requires typing out the path.

### 0.3 Absolute vs. Relative Paths

Understanding how R finds files is essential to avoiding the common `"File not found"` error.

|  |  |  |
|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| **Type** | **Description** | **Example** |
| **Absolute Path** | The full "GPS address" from the root drive. | *C:/Users/Name/Project/data/counts.csv* |
| **Relative Path** | A shorthand address starting from your **current** folder. | *data/counts.csv* |

::: callout-tip
**Best Practice:** Keep your data and your R script in the same folder (or a sub-folder) and use **Relative Paths**. This makes your project "portable"—it will work for anyone you share it with!
:::

::: callout-warning
**Warning:** Using `setwd()` is generally **discouraged in shared projects** because the path on your computer won't exist on your colleague's computer.

Why?

Because a path like `C:/Users/Martina/...` does not exist on your colleague’s computer. If you share your script, their R will crash immediately.

**Best Practice:** Use **R Projects (`.Rproj`)**. When you open an R Project, R automatically sets the working directory to that folder. This allows you to use **Relative Paths**, making your code "portable" so it works for anyone, anywhere.
:::

### 0.4 Best Practices: Organizing Project Files and Setting Working Directories

A **Working Directory** is the "Home Base" for your R session. It is the specific folder where you tell the computer to start looking for files.

#### **The Real-Life Analogy**

Imagine you want to ask a friend to find a specific bag for you. If you are starting from scratch, you need to provide them with the full, detailed address:

> *Canada, Quebec, Montreal, 3755 Côte Ste-Catherine Road, LDI, Bloomfield Lecture Hall.*

It works, but it is a mouthful!

It is the same for a computer. If you want the program to find a file without any context, you need to provide the full address (an **Absolute Path**):

> `"C:/Users/Martina/McGillProject/Thesis/Experiment1/data.csv"`

Typing this every time is tedious and prone to errors.

#### **What if we set a Working Directory?**

Setting a working directory is like "teleporting" your friend directly to the **Bloomfield Lecture Hall**. Now, you don't need to say "Canada, Quebec..."; you just say:

> *"Look in the third row."*

By telling the computer to relocate its attention to a specific folder, you can use shorter, simpler paths ( **Relative Paths**) to locate files.

> `"data.csv"`

#### **Good Practice: The "Project-Based" Approach**

The best way to handle this in R is to create a dedicated folder for each project.

-   Store all related **raw data**, **scripts**, and **output figures** inside this one folder.

-   Set your **Working Directory** to be that folder.

In RStudio, we use **RStudio Projects (`.Rproj`)** to do this automatically. When you open a project file, R immediately "teleports" to that folder, so your code works instantly without you needing to type out long file paths.

::: callout-note
**💡 The Gold Standard: Using RStudio Projects (`.Rproj`)**

Instead of manually typing `setwd()` (which is considered bad practice because it "hard-codes" your computer's folder structure), you could use **RStudio Projects**.

**How to do it:**

1.  Go to the top right of RStudio and click **New Project**.

2.  Choose **New Directory** → **New Project**.

3.  Name your folder (e.g., `Thesis_Bioinfo_2026`).

**The Magic:** Whenever you open that project file, RStudio automatically sets your working directory to that folder. You never have to type a full address again!
:::

::: callout-note
You can have as many project folders as you like (e.g., `Thesis_Chapter1`, `Coursework_Bioinfo`); they are self-contained and won't influence each other.
:::

::: callout-tip
**📂 Recommended Folder Structure**

For scientific research, keeping your "home base" organized is essential. Here is a standard template for a bioinformatics project:

|  |  |
|----|----|
| **Folder** | **Purpose** |
| **`data/`** | Raw, untouched data files (e.g., `.csv`, `.fastq`). |
| **`scripts/`** | Your R scripts or Quarto files. |
| **`output/`** | Processed data and cleaned tables. |
| **`figures/`** | Final plots saved for your thesis or paper. |
| **`Thesis_Project.Rproj`** | The "Master Key" that opens your project. |

Now, if you move your project folder to a USB drive or email it to a professor, and the code still runs without errors.

## 1. Writing Data Tables

After cleaning or filtering your data, you need to save your results to your hard drive.

### 1.1 Preparing the Demo Data

We will use the `gapminder` dataset to practice. We will create two subsets: one for Australia and one for the continent of Africa.

```{r}
#| message: false
if (!require("gapminder", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("gapminder")
library(gapminder)
```

```{r}
#| collapse: true
dim(gapminder)

summary(gapminder$lifeExp)

aust <- gapminder[gapminder$country == "Australia",]
africa <- gapminder[gapminder$continent == "Africa",]
```

### 1.2 Saving as CSV with `write.csv()`

The Comma-Separated Value (.csv) is the universal language of data tables.

```{r}
#| eval: false

# Create a 'data' folder in your current working directory
dir.create("data")

# Save the Africa subset of the gapminder data
write.csv(africa, file = "data/gapminder_africa.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```

::: callout-caution
**The "Folder Not Found" Error**

R is a great calculator, but it isn't a folder manager. If you tell R to save a file in a folder named `data/` but that folder doesn't exist yet, R will throw an error: `No such file or directory`.

Before saving, you must create the folder manually or use this code:

```{r}
#| eval: false
# Create a 'data' folder in your current working directory
dir.create("data")
```
:::

### 1.3 Saving as TSV with `write.table()`

In bioinformatics, **Tab-Separated Value (.tsv)** files are often preferred because gene names or clinical notes sometimes contain commas, which can "break" a CSV file.

```{r}
#| eval: false
# Saving as a TSV (using sep = "\t")
write.table(aust, file = "data/gapminder_australia.tsv", sep = "\t", quote = FALSE, row.names = FALSE)
```

::: callout-note
-   **`sep = "\t"`**: Tells R to use a "Tab" to separate your values. Common ones are `","` (comma), `"\t"` (tab), and `""` (white space).

-   **`quote = FALSE`**: Prevents R from putting double quotes around every word, making the file much easier to read in a text editor.
:::

### 1.4 Exporting to Excel with `write_xlsx()`

Sometimes you need to share results with a collaborator who strictly uses Excel. The `writexl` package makes this easy.

```{r}
#| message: false
#| eval: false
if (!require("writexl", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("writexl")
library(writexl)

write_xlsx(aust, path = "data/gapminder_australia.xlsx")
```

### 1.5 Metadata and Versioning

Scientific data is iterative. You will likely generate 10 versions of the same table before your paper is published.

-   **The "Dated" Filename:** Never name a file `results_FINAL.csv`. Instead, use: `results_v1_2026-02-07.csv`. When exporting data, always include a date or version number in the filename. This prevents overwriting and tells you exactly when the data was generated.

-   **The `row.names = FALSE` Rule:** By default, R tries to save the row numbers (1, 2, 3...) into your file. This usually creates an annoying, unnamed "Column 1" in Excel. Setting this to `FALSE` keeps your data clean.

## 2. Reading Data Tables

### 2.1 Reading Text Files (.csv and .tsv)

#### **2.1.1 Base R**

These functions come pre-installed with R. They are reliable and don't require any extra libraries, but can be slow with very large genomic datasets.

> **`read.csv()`** Specifically designed for CSV files. It automatically assumes that your data is separated by commas (`,`).
>
> **`read.table()` (The "Parent" Function)** This is the most flexible tool in your kit. While `read.csv()` is "locked" to commas, `read.table()` lets you specify **any** separator. This is essential for tab-separated genomic files.

```{r}
#| eval: false
dataset <- read.csv("data/gapminder_africa.csv")
```

```{r}
#| eval: false
# Reading a Tab-Separated file (.tsv or .txt)
dataset <- read.table("data/gapminder_australia.tsv", 
                      header = TRUE,      # Does the first row have column names?
                      sep = "\t",         # What separates the data? (\t = tab)
                      stringsAsFactors = FALSE) # Keep text as text, not categories
```

::: callout-note
#### **Key Arguments for `read.table`:**

-   **`header = TRUE`**: Tells R that the first line contains the names of the columns.

-   **`sep`**: The character that separates your values. Common ones are `","` (comma), `"\t"` (tab), and `""` (white space).

-   **`dec`**: The character used for decimal points (useful if you are working with European data that uses a comma as a decimal).
:::

#### **2.1.2 `readr` (Tidyverse)**

Part of the Tidyverse, `read_csv()` is faster and better at "guessing" your data types correctly.

```{r}
#| eval: false
if (!require("readr", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("readr")
library(readr)

dataset <- read_csv("data/gapminder_africa.csv")
```

### 2.2 Reading from Excel (.xlsx)

R cannot read Excel files natively. You need the `readxl` package.

```{r}
#| eval: false
if (!require("readxl", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("readxl")
library(readxl)

dataset <- read_excel("data/gapminder_australia.xlsx", sheet = 1)
```

### 2.3 The "Point-and-Click" Method (Interactive)

If you are a beginner or can't remember the exact path to your file, use the **Import Dataset** button in the **Environment** panel (top-right).

1.  Click **Import Dataset**.

2.  Browse your computer and select your file.

3.  Look at the "Code Preview" box in the bottom-right of the window. RStudio writes the code for you! You should **copy and paste** that code into your script so that your work is reproducible next time.

::: callout-note
**Performance Limit:**

Avoid using the interactive importer for massive datasets (like 100MB+ genomic files). The "preview" window will try to load the data to show it to you, which can cause RStudio to freeze.

## 3. R-Specific Formats (.RDS and .RData)

Sometimes you want to save an object exactly as it is in R (e.g., a complex statistical model or a large list).

### 3.1 .RDS (Save one object)

Best for saving a single dataframe or list. You can give it a new name when you load it back in.

```{r}
#| eval: false
saveRDS(africa, file = "data/africa.RDS")

africa_reloaded <- readRDS("data/africa.RDS")
```

### 3.2 .RData (Save multiple objects)

Used to save your entire/some part of "Environment." When you load it, the variables appear with their original names.

```{r}
#| eval: false
save(africa, aust, file = "data/continents.RData")

load("data/continents.RData", verbose = TRUE)
```

### 3.3 Summary: RDS vs. RData vs. RProject

|  |  |  |
|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| **Format** | **Purpose** | **Best Use Case** |
| **.RDS** | Saves **one** object. | Saving a clean dataset to use in another script. |
| **.RData** | Saves **multiple** objects. | Saving your whole workspace before lunch. |
| **.Rproj** | Saves **settings/context**. | Keeping your file paths and open tabs organized. |
